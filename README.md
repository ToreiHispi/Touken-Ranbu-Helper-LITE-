# Touken Helper LITE
This extension only works with Google Chrome. This is the low memory, basic (OLD) touken helper.

The original Helper was made by weibo user moelynn, then translated into English by Oredare, Maitou, Seijuros, and Miiandering.

- Chrome may display a screen on startup regarding the extension - ignore it. The notice is normal behavior. It does this to every unpacked extension, as a safeguard against potentially malicious ones.
- The extension will malfunction for every new sword/kiwame added to the game. Please update the extension accordingly.
